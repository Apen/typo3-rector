# What Rector cannot do for you

Some people expecting simply too much of typo3-rector.
To avoid these high expectations this section in the documentation exists.

At the moment typo3-rector is not able to refactor the following things:

1. SignalSlots to PSR-14 Events
2. eID to PSR-15 Middleware
3. ObjectManager to PSR-11 Dependency Injection
