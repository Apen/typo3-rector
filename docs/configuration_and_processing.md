# Configuration and Processing

This library ships already with a bunch of configuration files organized by TYPO3 version.
To get you started quickly run the following command inside the root directory of your project:

```bash
./vendor/bin/typo3-rector typo3-init
```

The command generates a basic configuration skeleton which you can adapt to your needs.
The file is full of comments, so you can follow along what is going on.

Also have a look at the class [Typo3SetList](https://github.com/sabbelasichon/typo3-rector/blob/master/src/Set/Typo3SetList.php).
There you can find all the available sets you can configure in the configuration file.

To mitigate one of the most boring but also most tedious tasks, the TCA configuration, we offer dedicated sets for it.
LetÂ´s say you want to migrate the TCA from a TYPO3 7 project to a TYPO3 9 project add the following sets to your configuration file:

```php
<?php

// rector.php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Rector\Core\Configuration\Option;
use Ssch\TYPO3Rector\Set\Typo3SetList;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;

return static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $parameters = $containerConfigurator->parameters();
    $parameters->set(Option::SETS, [
       Typo3SetList::TCA_76,
       Typo3SetList::TCA_87,
       Typo3SetList::TCA_95,
    ]
    );
};
```

For more configuration options see [Rector README](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector#configuration).

After your adopt the configuration to your needs, run typo3-rector to simulate (hence the option -n) the future code fixes:

```bash
./vendor/bin/typo3-rector process packages/my_custom_extension --dry-run
```

Check if everything makes sense and run the process command without the `--dry-run` option to apply the changes.
